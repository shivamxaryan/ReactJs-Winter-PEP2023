Describe higher order functions.

In JavaScript, functions are treated as first-class citizens. We can treat functions as values and assign them to another variable, pass them as arguments to another function, or even return them from another function.

This ability of functions to act as first-class functions is what powers higher order functions in JavaScript.

Basically, a function which takes another function as an argument or returns a function is known as a higher order function.


    Argument -> 
                Input ->> Higher Order Function ->> A function 
                                                                <- Return



Example with a code -> 

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11];

function filterOdd(arr) {
  const filteredArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] % 2 !== 0) {
      filteredArr.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  return filteredArr;
}
console.log(filterOdd(arr));

// Output:
// [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 ]
